Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
 

Test case format:

For simplicity sake, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val = 1, the second node with val = 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

Adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

Example 1:
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

Example 2:
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

Example 3:
Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.

Example 4:
Input: adjList = [[2],[1]]
Output: [[2],[1]]
 
Constraints:
1 <= Node.val <= 100
Node.val is unique for each node.
Number of Nodes will not exceed 100.
There is no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

## 思路

* 官方参考答案：[见这篇分享](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/clone-graph/solution/ke-long-tu-by-leetcode-solution/)
* 可以分为BFS、DFS两种方式，但是本质一样
* 关键：除了克隆该节点的val数值之外，还需要通过对图的遍历克隆该点的邻接点，为了让遍历不陷入死循环，我们需要（用一个哈希表）记录下来已经遍历过的节点，遇到已经遍历过的点就不再继续
* 具体实现就是起始于给定点，克隆数值，放入哈希表，遍历其邻接点，更新克隆点的邻接点，再根据BFS/DFS继续遍历其邻接点...
* 复杂度：
  * 时间复杂度：O(N)，N为节点的数量
  * 空间复杂度：O(N)，N为节点的数量

## 代码

* DFS:

  ``` Python
  # Solution 1: DFS
  """
  # Definition for a Node.
  class Node:
      def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):
          self.val = val
          self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []
  """
  
  class Solution:
      # init a hashmap to store visited nodes
      # key: node, value: node
      def __init__(self):
          self.visited = {}
  
      def cloneGraph(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
          # if graph is empty
          if not node:
              return None
          # if already visited
          if node in self.visited:
              return self.visited[node]
          # if haven't visited
          # clone node without neighbors
          clone_node = Node(node.val, [])
          # put it into hashmap
          self.visited[node] = clone_node
          # update neighbors of clone node
          if node.neighbors:
              for neighbor in node.neighbors:
                  clone_node.neighbors.append(self.cloneGraph(neighbor))
          
          return clone_node
  ```

* BFS:

  ``` Python
  # Solution 2: BFS
  """
  # Definition for a Node.
  class Node:
      def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):
          self.val = val
          self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []
  """
  
  from collections import deque
  class Solution:
      def cloneGraph(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
          # init a hashmap to store visited nodes
          # key: node, value: node
          visited = {}
          if not node:
              return None
          
          # init queue
          queue = deque()
          queue.append(node)
          # put first node into the hashmap
          visited[node] = Node(node.val, [])
  
          # BFS
          while queue:
              # pop out the first one in queue
              cur_node = queue.popleft()
              # traverse all its neighbors
              for neighbor in cur_node.neighbors:
                  # if not visited, put it in the hashmap
                  # put it into queue and visit it later
                  if neighbor not in visited:
                      visited[neighbor] = Node(neighbor.val, [])
                      queue.append(neighbor)
                  # update clone node's neighbors
                  visited[cur_node].neighbors.append(visited[neighbor])
          
          # after BFS
          return visited[node]
  ```
