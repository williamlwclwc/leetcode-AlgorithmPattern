# 332 Reconstruct Itinerary 重新安排行程

## 关键词：深度优先搜索，邻接表

## 题目

``` Text
Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.

Note:
If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
One must use all the tickets once and only once.

Example 1:
Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]

Example 2:
Input: [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]

Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"].
             But it is larger in lexical order.

## 思路

* 深度优先搜索+邻接表的思路：

  1. 使用邻接表来存放某节点可前往的其他节点
2. 从“JFK”开始深搜，每前进一层就减掉一条路径
  3. 直到找到某个无路可去的节点就是我们想找的终点
4. 之后进行回溯，依次把当层递归的节点放到结果数组的最前面
  5. 返回结果数组即可

## 代码

``` Python
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def findItinerary(self, tickets: List[List[str]]) -> List[str]:
        # adjancent list
        adjList = defaultdict(list)
        for start, end in tickets:
            adjList[start] += [end]
        # sort adjacent list, pop will get the last item (the last should be the smallest one)
        for start in adjList:
            adjList[start].sort(reverse=True)
        # dfs
        result = []
        def _dfs(node):
            while adjList[node]:
                # walk one possible path, then remove the path
                # will end when one node have nowhere to go, then this node is our destination
                _dfs(adjList[node].pop())
            # quit when we find the final node
            # backtrack and put other nodes in the front each time
            result.insert(0, node)
        
        _dfs("JFK")
        return result
```
